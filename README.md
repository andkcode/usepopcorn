- useState and useEffect Hooks
- OMDb API
- CSS for styling
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or Yarn
- OMDb API Key

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/usepopcorn.git
   cd usepopcorn
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OMDb API key

## Project Structure

- `App.js`: Main application component
- `NavBar`: Navigation bar with logo and search
- `Main`: Primary content area
- `Box`: Reusable collapsible container
- `MovieList`: Displays search results
- `WatchedMoviesList`: Shows watched movies
- `WatchedSummary`: Provides statistics on watched movies

## Key Components

### Search Functionality
- Real-time movie searching
- Displays number of search results
- Fetches data from OMDb API

### Watched Movies Tracking
- Add movies to watched list
- Calculate average ratings
- Track runtime and personal ratings

## API Integration

The app uses the OMDb API to fetch movie data:
- Endpoint: `http://www.omdbapi.com/`
- Fetches movie details based on search query
- Handles loading and error states

## State Management

Utilizes React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for:
- Managing movie search results
- Tracking watched movies
- Handling loading and error states

## Error Handling

- Graceful error messages for API failures
- Loading indicators during data fetch
- Fallback UI for no search results

## Performance Considerations

- Minimal re-renders using React hooks
- Efficient state management
- Async data fetching with error handling

## Potential Improvements

- Implement movie details view
- Add ability to remove movies from watched list
- Persistent storage (localStorage/database)
- Implement user authentication
- Add more detailed movie filtering
